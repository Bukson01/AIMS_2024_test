# AIMS_2024_test
This repository contains a Python implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph. The code aims to efficiently compute the shortest route connecting all nodes in the graph together.

# Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

This Python code implements Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a weighted, undirected graph. The MST represents the shortest route connecting all nodes together.

## Usage:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/Bukson01/AIMS_2024_test.git

- Navigate to the cloned directory: cd AIMS_2024_test
- Run the Python script: python Prim's_MST_on_AIMS.py

- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the graph and weights.

## Features:
- Efficient implementation of Prim's algorithm.
- Ability to handle graphs with any number of nodes and weighted edges.
